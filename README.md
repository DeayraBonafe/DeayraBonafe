# Hi, I’m Deayra 👋  
Product Designer who builds. I work at the intersection of design, strategy and technology, turning complex problems into clear, scalable digital systems.  

Here on GitHub, I document what I create: prototypes, tools, workflows, SaaS experiments and product foundations I build with Bonafé Solutions.
